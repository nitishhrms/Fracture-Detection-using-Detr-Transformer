# Fracture Detection with Detection Transformer (DETR)

This project demonstrates how to use the **Detection Transformer (DETR)** for custom object detection, specifically for detecting fractures in medical images (X-rays, CT scans, etc.).

The code leverages the **DETR** model, which combines transformers with convolutional networks for end-to-end object detection.

### Overview

DETR (Detection Transformer) is a novel object detection architecture introduced by Facebook Research. Unlike traditional methods, DETR uses transformers in both the backbone and the object detection head, allowing it to perform object detection tasks directly without the need for many heuristics. 

In this project, we apply DETR for **fracture detection** to classify and locate fractures in medical images.

### Installation

To get started, you'll need to install the required libraries. Use the following commands:

```bash
# Upgrade pip
python -m pip install --upgrade pip

# Install dependencies
pip install supervision==0.3.0
pip install transformers
pip install pytorch-lightning
pip install timm
pip install cython
pip install pycocotools
pip install scipy
```

### Project Setup

1. Clone the repository or download the code.
2. Prepare your custom dataset (images of fractures and non-fractures).
3. Fine-tune the DETR model on your dataset using the instructions below.

### How It Works

1. **Pretrained Model**: The model is based on DETR, which has been pretrained on COCO and other datasets. You'll fine-tune it on your custom fracture dataset.
2. **Custom Dataset**: You'll need labeled images where fractures are annotated. The dataset should include bounding boxes around fractures and be in a format compatible with DETR (e.g., COCO format).
3. **Fine-tuning**: Fine-tune the DETR model on your dataset, and the model will learn to detect fractures in new images.

### Fine-tuning DETR on Custom Dataset

You can follow these steps to fine-tune DETR on your dataset:

1. **Prepare your data**: Ensure that your data is in a format that DETR accepts (COCO format is recommended).
2. **Training Script**: Run the training script to start fine-tuning the model.
3. **Evaluation**: After training, evaluate the model on test data to check its performance.

### Usage

Once the model is trained, you can use it to detect fractures in new images:

```python
from transformers import DetrImageProcessor, DetrForObjectDetection
import torch
from PIL import Image
import requests

# Load the model and processor
model = DetrForObjectDetection.from_pretrained("facebook/detr-resnet-50")
processor = DetrImageProcessor.from_pretrained("facebook/detr-resnet-50")

# Load an image
image = Image.open("path_to_image.jpg")

# Preprocess the image
inputs = processor(images=image, return_tensors="pt")

# Perform object detection
outputs = model(**inputs)

# Post-process the results (e.g., draw bounding boxes around detected fractures)
# You can visualize the output or save it for further analysis
```
